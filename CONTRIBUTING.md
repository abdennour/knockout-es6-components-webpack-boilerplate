# Unit-tests

**Framework** We were hoping to use Mocha, however, Mocha is still not compatible with Node 8 unless we use transpiler which is not recommended.

**Filename convention** The name of file that includes unit-tests is suffixed by `.spec.js`

**Running tests**

```
npm test
```

**Watch test**

```
npm test -- --watch
```

# Pull-request

**Code coverage** Unit-tests must cover 80% at least.

**Create issue before** We prefer to describe the problem that pull-request is solving in issue. Then link this issue with that pull-request.
